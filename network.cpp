//golang and c++ local network interface
//the json file in transaction is imported in networking.cpp and then sent/broadcasted over to the network
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#include"Transaction.h"  // or I don not know as of now that the transactions.json is to be included in here ?


//this should be integrated with the wallet.cpp somehow mate !
//this will use only the public keys as addressees generated to send or receive the broadcasts from the network mate
